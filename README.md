# Language_Translator_py
This program written in Python is a language translator that translates certain English words to other languages.<br/>

## Logistics:
The program reads data from the ***language.csv*** file, which serves as a multi-language dictionary with a selection of words. The original and translated words of your choice will be automatically saved to a ***.txt*** file upon completion, and you can either name the file yourself or choose to use the default file name, which is the language you chooses to translate into.
## Purpose:
This program is designed to demonstrate the basic knowledge of reading and writing files using Python, as well as the knowledge of defining and calling funtions in Python.
