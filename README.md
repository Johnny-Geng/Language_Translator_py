# Language_Translator_py
This program written in Python is a language translator that translates certain English words to other languages.
The program reads data from the language.csv file, which serves as a multi-language dictionary with a selection of words. The original and translated words of your choice will be automatically saved to a .txt file upon completion. This program is designed to demonstrate the basic knowledge of reading and writing a file using Python, as well as the knowledge of defining and calling funtions in Python.
